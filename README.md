# Zeitgeistgothic

## Task
We were tasked with testing an online website: <https://www.zeitgeistgothic.co.uk/> and had to plan how to test the website.

As a group, we discussed how our Kanban board should be set out. The board consited of the following columns:

* **Prioritise:** 1 being high and 3 being low
* Execute
* Review
* **Definition of done:** has the code been peer reviewed and has it been indented properly, implementing DRY.

We then derived user stories which would assist us in creating our test cases/conditions, which were priortised from 1-3; 1 being the test which tests the most functional aspect of the website. Each member of the group took responsibilty on which user story they wanted to complete.
