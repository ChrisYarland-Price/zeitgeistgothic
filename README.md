# Zeitgeistgothic

## Task
We were tasked with testing an online website: <https://www.zeitgeistgothic.co.uk/> and had to plan how to test the website.

As a group, we discussed how our Kanban board should be set out. The board consited of the following columns:

* **Prioritise:** 1 being high and 3 being low
* Execute
* Review
* **Definition of done:** has the code been peer reviewed and has it been indented properly, implementing DRY.

We then derived user stories which would assist us in creating our test cases/conditions, which were priortised from 1-3; 1 being the test which tests the most functional aspect of the website. Each member of the group took responsibilty on which user story they wanted to complete.

## Tasks undertaken by each member

* Myself and Luke did the POM for a product page, in this instance it was for the 'word up tee'.
* Did the before hook where we could call an instance variable which assisted us in implementing DRY when running tests. Achieved by adding a new method called 'added to basket' in the 'word up tee' POM file. Hooks.rb file created in support folder, where the appropriate code written. 

#### Luke
* Pair programmed with Abass the shop pages, this includes the page object models of shop page and shop page two, defining and writing tests. As well as the shop page myself and Abass also completed the POM and tests for the product page although this only testing the 'word up tee' due to a lack of time to test more products. 
* Also wrote the methods which were used in the before hook.
